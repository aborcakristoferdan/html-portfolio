<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Kristofer Dan A. Aborca, 27 years old and I live in Philippines. I graduated with a Bachelors Degree of Science in Pharmacy at Riverside College Incorporated in Bacolod City last March 2017. I was born on June 8, 1995. I have 6 siblings and I am the youngest among us.
My father was a Sea farer while my mother was a licensed teacher in our hometown. My father died in 2016 due to Stage 4 lung cancer at 63 years old. My mother is still alive and well although she is already showing signs of health issues.</p>

<p>Aside from being a medical professional, I also want to be a developer/programmer. I want to explore the world of technology more since it is now one of the booming industries in the world. People's current lifestyle mostly revolve around technology such as phones, televisons, internet, ATMs etc. Due to this, I became interested and decided to learn more about it.</p>
